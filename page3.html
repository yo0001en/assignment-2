    <h1>We believe in working out with intent.</h1>
	
    <p>
        Our training is designed to serve up measurable results, but never at the expense of your safety. 
		<br>
		<br>
		We train using StrongFit principles, fundamental patterns of human movement, so that you train the central nervous system for improved mental and physical performance.    
		</p>
		
		<h1>So what is StrongFit?</h1>
		<p>As a training method, the principles of StrongFit help coaches determine deficiencies, weaknesses or imbalances of an individual and provide a remedy through movement. A weakness may be caused by an existing or previous injury or it may be caused by years, if not a lifetime, of practicing poor or imbalanced posture or patterns. In sport athletes, imbalances may result from specialization. Prescriptions to fixing these “key logs” often come in the form of sled sprints, yoke carries and sandbag tosses - and it’s intense. It’s physical therapy on steroids.
		<br>
		<br>
		StrongFit complements everything that you are passionate about- yoga, martial arts, cycling, running, marathon, dragon boating, waterpolo, weightlifting, powerlifting and yes, CrossFit too.
